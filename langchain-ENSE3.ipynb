The DS9297 datasheet provides information on the STGW25H120DF2 and STGWA25H120DF2, which are trench gate field-stop IGBTs from the H series. These components have a voltage rating of 1200 V and a current rating of 25 A, making them suitable for high-speed applications.\\n\\n2. The maximum junction temperature for these IGBTs is 175 °C, ensuring reliable operation even under high-temperature conditions. \\n\\n3. With a VCE(sat) of 2.1 V (typical) at a current of 25 A, these IGBTs offer low on-state voltage drop, minimizing power losses in the circuit.\\n\\n4. The STGW25H120DF2 and STGWA25H120DF2 IGBTs have a minimum short circuit withstand time of 5 μs at a junction temperature of 150 °C, making them robust and capable of handling short circuit conditions.\\n\\n5.
